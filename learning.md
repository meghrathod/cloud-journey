### 3.1. DevOps

* deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace
* automate the process of delivering software
* development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.”
  * meaning that development teams and business operations teams work together to get desired outputs
* Benefits of DevOps
  * Speed
  * Rapid Delivery
  * Reliability
  * Scalability
  * Improved Collaboration
  * Security

### 3.2. DevSecOps

* DevOps isn’t just about development and operations teams. If you want to take full advantage of the agility and responsiveness of a DevOps approach, IT security must also play an integrated role in the full life cycle of your apps.
* In the past, the role of security was isolated to a specific team in the final stage of development. That wasn’t as problematic when development cycles lasted months or even years, but those days are over. Effective DevOps ensures rapid and frequent development cycles (sometimes weeks or days), but outdated security practices can undo even the most efficient DevOps initiatives.

### 3.3. Kubernetes

* It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
* It provides a simple and easy way to deploy applications.
* Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve
